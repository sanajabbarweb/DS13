# **Head Pose Estimation and Facial Expression Detection**

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes videos and images to extract advanced facial insights. It provides two core functionalities:  

### **1. Head Pose Estimation**  
- Splits the input (video or image) into individual frames.  
- Detects faces in each frame and identifies facial landmarks.  
- Computes yaw, pitch, and roll values based on these landmarks.  
- Estimates the head pose accurately using the computed values.  

### **2. Facial Expression Detection**  
- Identifies and categorizes facial expressions from the input images or video frames.  

---

## **Key Features**  
- Accepts videos or images as input.  
- Uses facial landmark detection to compute orientation and pose.  
- Supports real-time or batch processing for head pose estimation.  
- Detects and categorizes various facial expressions.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **MediaPipe**  
- **NumPy**  

---

## **Usage**  
1. Upload a video or image file as input.  
2. Run the program to process the input and extract frames.  
3. View the computed yaw, pitch, and roll values for each detected face to understand the head pose.  
4. Check for detected facial expressions in the second part of the output.
